## Musical instrument recognition using CNN
An attempt to use convolutional neural networks to improve automatic instrument recognition both in monophonic and polyphonic signals.

Currently only using the [IRMAS](http://www.mtg.upf.edu/download/datasets/irmas) and the [MedleyDB](http://medleydb.weebly.com/) datasets but looking for more data.
